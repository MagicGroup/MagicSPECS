+ `README.md` for version 7.4 of Vim: Vi IMproved.
+ 
+ 
+ ## What is VIM ##
+ 
+ Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.  Many new features
+ have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line history,
+ on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations, etc.
+ There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI) available.  See
+ `runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt` for differences with Vi.
+ 
+ This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
+ All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
+ with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
+ defined by the user, and the mouse can be used.
+ 
+ Vim runs under Amiga DOS, MS-DOS, MS-Windows (95, 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP, Vista,
+ 7), Atari MiNT, Macintosh, BeOS, VMS, RISC OS, OS/2 and almost all flavours of
+ UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very difficult.
+ 
+ 
+ ## Distribution ##
+ 
+ There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
+ This `README.md` file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
+ documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
+ Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
+ Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
+ want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
+ an overview of currently available distributions.
+ 
+ 
+ ## Documentation ##
+ 
+ The vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Mostly it can be
+ started as `vimtutor`.  See `:help tutor` for more information.
+ 
+ The best is to use `:help` in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
+ `runtime/doc/help.txt`.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
+ files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
+ Vim.  See `:help user-manual`.
+ 
+ 
+ ## Copying ##
+ 
+ Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
+ encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
+ `runtime/doc/uganda.txt` for details (do `:help uganda` inside Vim).
+ 
+ Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
+ unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
+ text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
+ The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
+ distribute it.
+ 
+ 
+ ## Sponsoring ##
+ 
+ Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
+ your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
+ working on Vim please send a donation.
+ 
+ Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
+ in Uganda.  See `runtime/doc/uganda.txt`.  But at the same time donations
+ increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!
+ 
+ For the most recent information about sponsoring look on the Vim web site:
+ 	http://www.vim.org/sponsor/
+ 
+ 
+ ## Compiling ##
+ 
+ If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
+ obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
+ `src` directory.  See `src/INSTALL` for instructions.
+ 
+ 
+ ## Installation ##
+ 
+ See one of these files for system-specific instructions:
+ 
+ 	README_ami.txt		Amiga
+ 	README_unix.txt		Unix
+ 	README_dos.txt		MS-DOS and MS-Windows
+ 	README_os2.txt		OS/2
+ 	README_mac.txt		Macintosh
+ 	README_vms.txt		VMS
+ 
+ There are more `README_*.txt` files, depending on the distribution you used.
+ 
+

+ lists to discuss them with Vim users and developers:
