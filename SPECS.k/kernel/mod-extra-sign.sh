# We need to sign modules we've moved from <path>/kernel/ to <path>/extra/
# during mod-extra processing by hand.  The 'modules_sign' Kbuild target can
# "handle" out-of-tree modules, but it does that by not signing them.  Plus,
# the modules we've moved aren't actually out-of-tree.  We've just shifted
# them to a different location behind Kbuild's back because we are mean.

# This essentially duplicates the 'modules_sign' Kbuild target and runs the
# same commands for those modules.
