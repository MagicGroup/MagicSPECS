Subject: [PATCH] uvcvideo: Reset the bytesused field when recycling an erroneous buffer

Buffers marked as erroneous are recycled immediately by the driver if
the nodrop module parameter isn't set. The buffer payload size is reset
to 0, but the buffer bytesused field isn't. This results in the buffer
being immediately considered as complete, leading to an infinite loop in
interrupt context.

Fix the problem by resetting the bytesused field when recycling the
buffer.
