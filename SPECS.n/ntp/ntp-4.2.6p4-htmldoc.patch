 		<h4 id="descr">Description</h4>
 		<p>The <tt>ntpd</tt> program is an operating system daemon that synchronises the system clock with remote NTP&nbsp;time servers or local reference clocks. It is a complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4, but also retains compatibility with version 3, as defined by RFC-1305, and version 1 and 2, as defined by RFC-1059 and RFC-1119, respectively. The program can operate in any of several modes, as described on the <a href="assoc.html">Association Management</a> page, and with both symmetric key and public key cryptography, as described on the <a href="manyopt.html">Authentication Options</a> page.</p>
-		<p>The <tt>ntpd</tt> program ordinarily requires a configuration file as desccribe on the Configuration Commands and Options collection above. However a client can discover remote servers and configure them automatically. This makes it possible to deploy a fleet of workstations without specifying configuration details specific to the local environment. Further details are on the <a href="manyopt.html">Automatic Server Discovery</a> page.</p>

However a client can discover remote servers and configure them automatically. This makes it possible to deploy a fleet of workstations without specifying configuration details specific to the local environment. Further details are on the <a href="manyopt.html">Automatic Server Discovery</a> page.</p>
 		<p>Once the NTP software distribution has been compiled and installed and the configuration file constructed, the next step is to verify correct operation and fix any bugs that may result. Usually, the command line that starts the daemon is included in the system startup file, so it is executed only at system boot time; however, the daemon can be stopped and restarted from root at any time. Once started, the daemon will begin sending and receiving messages, as specified in the configuration file.</p>
 		<h4 id="time">Setting the Time and Frequency</h4>
 		<p>The <tt>ntpd</tt> program operates by exchanging messages with one or more servers at designated intervals ranging from about one minute to about 17 minutes. When started, the program requires several exchanges while the algorithms accumulate and groom the data before setting the clock. The initial delay to set the clock can be reduced using options on the <a href="confopt.html">Server Options</a> page.</p>
-		<p>Most compters today incorporate a time-of-year (TOY) chip to maintain the time during periods when the power is off. When the machine is booted, the chip is used to initialize the operating system time. In case there is no TOY chip or the TOY&nbsp;time is more than 1000 s from the server&nbsp;time, <tt>ntpd</tt> assumes something must be terribly wrong and exits with a panic message to the system operator. With the <tt>-g</tt> option the clock will be initially set to the server time regardless of the chip time. However, once the clock has been set, an error greater than 1000 s will cause <tt>ntpd</tt> to exit anyway.</p>

With the <tt>-g</tt> option the clock will be initially set to the server time regardless of the chip time. However, once the clock has been set, an error greater than 1000 s will cause <tt>ntpd</tt> to exit anyway.</p>
 		<p>Under ordinary conditions, <tt>ntpd</tt> slews the clock so that the time is effectively continuous and never runs backwards. If due to extreme network congestion an error spike exceeds the <i>step threshold</i>, by default 128 ms, the spike is discarded. However, if the error persists for more than the <i>stepout threshold</i>, by default 900 s, the system clock is stepped to the correct value. In practice the need for a step has is extremely rare and almost always the result of a hardware failure. With the <tt>-x</tt> option the step threshold is increased to 600 s. Other options are available using the <tt>tinker</tt> command on the <a href="miscopt.html">Miscellaneous Options</a> page.</p>
 		<p>The issues should be carefully considered before using these options. The maximum slew rate possible is limited to 500 parts-per-million (PPM) by the Unix kernel. As a result, the clock can take 2000 s for each second the clock is outside the acceptable range. During this interval the clock will not be consistent with any other network clock and the system cannot be used for distributed applications that require correctly synchronized network time.</p>
 		<p>The frequency file, usually called <tt>ntp.drift</tt>, contains the latest estimate  of clock frequency. If this file does not exist when <tt>ntpd</tt> is started, it enters a special mode designed to measure the particular frequency directly. The measurement takes 15 minutes, after which the frequency is set and <tt>ntpd</tt> resumes normal mode where the time and frequency are continuously adjusted. The frequency file is updated at intervals of an hour or more depending on the measured clock stability.</p>
