+:![<history number>/<history match>]
+  The ! command is used to recall previous commands in your command
+  history for re-execution.  The ! command is unique in that when it
+  is used, it leaves the matching history entry in the input line for
+  re-editing.  You can specify a history entry either by its number
+  in the history list, or by a match with a given wildcard expression.
+  For example:
+    /!10
+  will put entry 10 in the history list into the input line.  
+  The following:
+    /!/MSG 
+  will search the history list for a line beginning with /MSG and
+  put it in the input line (an * is implied at the end of /MSG).  When
+  using ! with a wildcard expression, subsequent uses of
+  the ! command continue their search in the history list from where 
+  they left off.  This is reset to the end of the list when a command
+  is executed that adds an entry to the history list. Also, if a
+  wildcard expression is used once, subseqent uses of ! with no
+  expression will use the previous wild card expression.  For example,
+  the following:
+    /!/MSG
+    /!
+  The first call returns the first match of /MSG in the history list, 
+  and the second returns the next match, and so on.  This is useful 
+  in the following key binding:
+    /BIND ^R PARSE_COMMAND /!$"Search: "
+  With this, you can hit ^R and you will be prompted for a search
+  string in the history list.  If you want to then repeat the search
+  you simply have to hit ^R and hit return, since it will use
+  the previous search by default.
+  
+  Lastly, ! may be used in command aliases as well.  When it is
+  embedded in an alias it simply executes the matching history entry
+  without first putting it in the input line for re-editing.

+:ALIAS [[-]<alias> [<commands>]]
+ (snatched from ircII-2.8.2 help)
+  Creates a command alias for <commands>. Commands do not need to be
+  prefixed with a command character, in fact they shouldn't!
+  If you want an alias to type something to the channel or query
+  use SEND or SAY. You can use ';' to put multiple commands in a row.
+
+  Special character sequences, usually ircII variables, are prefixed
+  with '$'.  There are certain $ sequences built in to IRCII for getting
+  such information as your nickname and current channel, plus you can
+  expand your own variables and system variables using the $ format.
+  You can also expand functions, substituting their return values.
+  See ASSIGN for more on this.
+
+  Here are some simple alias examples:
+    ALIAS HELLO MSG $0 Hello, $0! $1-
+  This alias can be used by typing:
+    HELLO BigCheese How are you?
+  This would act as though you had typed:
+    MSG BigCheese Hello, BigCheese! How are you?
+  ALIAS with just the <alias> argument shows the current alias
+  for that word.  ALIAS with no argument shows all current
+  for that word.  ALIAS with no argument shows all current
+  aliases. To remove an alias, use ALIAS -<alias>.
+
+  To use more than one command in an alias, separate them by ';'.
+
+  When using ALIAS in a script it is frequently useful to surround
+  the contents of your alias with { }s when you want to put more than
+  one commands in an alias. E.g:
+    ALIAS loadcommon {
+      LOAD netsplit
+      LOAD troy
+    }
+  is the same as
+    ALIAS loadcommon LOAD netsplit;LOAD troy
+  but lacks the ; and it much easier to read in a script or the .ircrc file.
+
+  For more specific information about the $ uses and more examples,
+  see the specific help files listed below.

+:ASSIGN [[-]<user-variable> [<whatever>]]
+ (snatched from ircII-2.8.2 help)
+  Assign lets you create user variables which are automatically
+  expanded by ircII in aliases using the $variable-name format.
+  For example, if you had defined:
+    /assign me The Big Cheese
+  Then, in an alias, $me would expand to "The Big Cheese".  These
+  are straight textual substitutions.  You can use these kind
+  of variables as counters and indexes into lists as well.  For
+  example:
+    /assign index 0
+    /assign index ${index+1}
+  The first line sets "index" to 0, the seconds increments index by 1.
+  Note that the second will always be expanded if used in another
+  alias (where $ are normally expanded).  If you want it to be
+  expanded if typed at the input line, you must first set
+  INPUT_ALIASES to ON.
+
+  Note: In the above example, the mathematical expression must be
+  enclosed by {}'s  otherwise the + would be treated as an alias
+  delimiter and the addition not performed. (See @ as well)
+
+  Suppose now you wanted to use index to get a single word in a list, 
+  you could do:
+    /ALIAS WORD echo $($index)
+  Then doing:
+    /WORD This is a test
+  would display the index'th word in the list.  
+  The $($index) format does the following: it parses the text
+  between the () as a sub-alias.  The "$index" is thus evaluated
+  and returns it's value.  This value is then replaced for the () 
+  expression and evaluated.  So, if you had:
+    /assign index 1
+  Then, the following would be evaluated:
+    $index becomes 1 which given
+    $(1) which becomes simply $1
+  Thus the $1 argument is used.  
+  This functionality can be nested. This the following:
+    /assign A Hey You!
+    /assign B A
+    /assign C B
+    /ALIAS NESTING echo $($($C))
+  will cause NESTING to display "Hey You!"
+
+  The following format are also legal:
+    $#name	evaluates to the number of words in name
+    $@name	evaluates to the number of characters in name
+  You can use these with the mathematical expressions as well, 
+  for example:
+    /assign foo Testing One Two
+    /echo $#foo $@foo
+    /assign junk ${#foo + @foo}
+  The echo line will display 3 15 and the variable junk have the 
+  value 18.
+
+  Additionally, values assigned to FUNCTION_RETURN are taken to be
+  the return value of a function.
+
+IMPORTANT NOTE:
+  There is a special version of this command called @
+  for use in aliases and scripts.  It is well suited to mathematical
+  operations.  Its use over assign is highly recommended.
