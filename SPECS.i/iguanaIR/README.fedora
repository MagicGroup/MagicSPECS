Fedora README
=============

On recent kernels (F17+) you will need to disable the kernel ir stuff
to make the iguanaIR driver work. Basically, blacklist all rc_* 
modules using a file in /etc/modprobe.d. The list varies, my 
own file is:

    blacklist rc_medion_x10_or2x
    blacklist rc_pinnacle_pctv_hd
    blacklist ati_remote
    blacklist rc_core
