Subject: [PATCH] Fix spelling in pcretest(1) manual

I kept some non-dictionary words to be consistent.
Credits to John Bradshaw.

Spelling refused by upstream <http://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1081#c3>:

I have applied these patches, except for "termi-nated", because my
Collins dictionary of spelling and word division shows "termin-ate" and
"termin-ating". I do know that there is a cultural difference between
British and American hyphenation conventions; I try to follow the
British ones, as exemplified in the Collins.
