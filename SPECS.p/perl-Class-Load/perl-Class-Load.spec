%description
require EXPR only accepts Class/Name.pm style module names, not Class::Name.
How frustrating! For that, we provide load_class 'Class::Name'.

It's often useful to test whether a module can be loaded, instead of throwing
an error when it's not available. For that, we provide
try_load_class 'Class::Name'.

Finally, sometimes we need to know whether a particular class has been loaded.
Asking %%INC is an option, but that will miss inner packages and any class for
which the filename does not correspond to the package name. For that, we
provide is_class_loaded 'Class::Name'.

%changelog
* Wed Dec 12 2012 Liu Di <liudidi@gmail.com> - 0.20-3
- 为 Magic 3.0 重建

* Fri Jul 20 2012 Fedora Release Engineering <rel-eng@lists.fedoraproject.org> - 0.20-2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_18_Mass_Rebuild

* Sun Jul 15 2012 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 0.20-1
- Update to 0.20
  - Same as the most recent 0.19, but with a new version (CPAN RT#78389)

* Sun Jul 15 2012 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 0.19-7
- New upstream re-release of 0.19 by DROLSKY
  - The load_class() subroutine now returns the class name on success
    (CPAN RT#76931)
  - Exceptions and errors from Class::Load no longer contain references to line
    numbers in Class::Load or Module::Runtime; this applies to exceptions
    thrown by load_class, load_first_existing_class, and load_optional_class,
    as well as the error returned by try_load_class
  - Exceptions are now croaked properly so they appear to come from the calling
    code, not from an internal subroutine; this makes the exceptions look more
    like the ones thrown by Perl's require (CPAN RT#68663)
- This release by DROLSKY -> update source URL
- BR: perl(Scalar::Util) for the module
- BR: perl(lib) for the test suite
- Drop buildreqs perl(strict) and perl(warnings) - not dual-lived

- Update to 0.19 (no functional changes)
- This release by DOY -> update source URL
- BR: perl(Exporter)
- Don't need to remove empty directories from buildroot

* Sat Feb 18 2012 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 0.18-1
- Update to 0.18:
  - Require Package::Stash ≥ 0.14 (CPAN RT#75095)

* Sun Feb 12 2012 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 0.17-1
- Update to 0.17:
  - Require Module::Runtime 0.012, which has a number of useful bug fixes
  - A bug in Class::Load caused test failures when Module::Runtime 0.012 was
    used with Perl 5.8.x (CPAN RT#74897)

* Thu Feb  9 2012 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 0.15-1
- Update to 0.15:
  - Small test changes to accomodate latest version of Module::Implementation
- BR: at least version 0.04 of perl(Module::Implementation)

* Tue Feb  7 2012 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 0.14-1
- Update to 0.14:
  - Use Module::Implementation to handle loading the XS or PP versions of the
    code; using this module fixes a few bugs
  - Under taint mode, setting an implementation in the
    CLASS_LOAD_IMPLEMENTATION env var caused a taint error
  - An invalid value in the CLASS_LOAD_IMPLEMENTATION env var is now detected
    and reported immediately; no attempt is made to load an invalid
    implementation
- BR: perl(Module::Implementation)
- BR: perl(base), perl(Carp), perl(strict) and perl(warnings) for completeness
- Drop version requirement for perl(Package::Stash), no longer present upstream
- Drop explicit runtime dependencies, no longer needed
- Don't BR: perl(Class::Load::XS) or perl(Pod::Coverage::Moose) if we're
  bootstrapping
- Don't run the release tests when bootstrapping as the Pod coverage test will
  fail in the absence of Pod::Coverage::Moose

* Tue Oct 25 2011 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 0.12-1

    its functionality

  Module::Runtime ≥ 0.009 will not be available prior to F-16

* Tue Sep  6 2011 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 0.10-1

  - Fix is_class_loaded to ignore $ISA (but still look for @ISA) when trying to
    determine whether a class is loaded
  - Lots of internals cleanup
- BR: perl(Package::Stash) ≥ 0.32 and perl(Try::Tiny)
