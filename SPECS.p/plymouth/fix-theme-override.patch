Subject: [PATCH] plymouth-populate-initrd: fix THEME_OVERRIDE with empty conf

If you set PLYMOUTH_THEME_NAME to override the theme in an initrd
(as e.g. lorax does when building upgrade.img), plymouth-populate-initrd
tries to edit plymouthd.conf to enable that theme.

Unfortunately, the existing `sed` line doesn't work if your
plymouthd.conf is empty or all commented out - which is how we currently
ship it.

So before modifying the config, make sure it has a [Daemon] section
header, and a Theme=[placeholder] line for us to modify.

Resolves: RHBZ#1223344
