Set-Object used to be licensed under the Perl Artistic license, and
the documentation still says so (I expect it being updated with the
next upstream release).  Due to the artistic license not being
accepted as free license by the FSF I've asked the authors whenever
they agree to relicense the package and fortunaly they did, so the
package now carries the same license as perl itself (which is the
choice between Artistic and GPL).

The relevant messages from the authors (Jean-Louis Leroy and Sam
Vilain) are listed below.

Hello Gerd. 

I agree to relicense Set::Object under the same terms as (current) Perl 
itself - which is probably the choice between two licenses: Artistic 2.0 and 
GPL. 

Cordially,
Jean-Louis

That's right, of Sound Object Logic.

Yes, I can speak for that copyright holder, and they are happy to
license under any FSF-approved Free Software license, including the Perl
Artistic/GPL disjunction.

Contact Jean-Louis - if nothing comes back I might have to investigate a
rewrite.

Cheers,
Sam.
