Subject: [PATCH 3/5] Fix build with Qt >= 5.4.2

Or with commit 3eca75d cherry picked. Qt will now require using
-fPIC flag for it's consumers. For cmake Qt5Core exports the flag in
it's public interface, but since visibility try_compile test
does not link against any lib, we need to pass collected CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS
(which have gathered -fPIC flag at that phase)

This, for now only resolves the issue with gcc builds.
Other compilers will need to be checked.
