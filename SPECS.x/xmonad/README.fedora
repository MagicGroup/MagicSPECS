= Packaging =
xmonad in Fedora is provided by 3 subpackages:

- xmonad-basic: just the base window manager and X session files
- xmonad: additionally installs the devel library files needed to configure and customize xmonad
- xmonad-mate: additionally includes a mate session file and requires mate-session-manager and terminal

= Starting from GDM =
xmonad can be started from GDM by selecting "xmonad" in the session menu.

For MATE support please install xmonad-mate
and select "xmonad MATE" in GDM's session menu.

= xmonad-start =
Fedora's xmonad-start script starts up xmonad and
displays a welcome dialog when initially run.

With the xmonad, xmonad-config, or xmonad packages installed,
xmonad-start will create a basic "~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs" file
configured for desktops, and pre-compile it if necessary.

= Configuration references =
- xmonad man-page
- /usr/share/doc/xmonad-$version/xmonad.hs (default upstream configuration)

xmonad-contrib a gentler introduction to xmonad and tiling.
