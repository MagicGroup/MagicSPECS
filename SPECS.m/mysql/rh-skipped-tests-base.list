# Disable the outfile_loaddata test, which as of 5.1.38 is giving
# platform-dependent results, with the "expected" results being arguably the
# wrong ones.  This is upstream at http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=46895
# (note that upstream has also disabled it, but only for Solaris, so we still
# need to disable it here).
# Still broken in 5.5.14, despite alleged fix.

outfile_loaddata          : bug#46895 code wrong, expected results wrong too

# Disable sys_vars.plugin_dir_basic, which is broken because
# mysql-test-run doesn't set the right value of MYSQL_LIBDIR.
# Upstream at http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52223
# Still fails in 5.5.16, even though upstream marked it closed.

sys_vars.plugin_dir_basic : bug#52223 fails for lib64 library directory

# Disable innodb.innodb, which is showing platform-dependent results
# as of 5.5.9.  Upstream at http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=60155
