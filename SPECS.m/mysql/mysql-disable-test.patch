Disable the outfile_loaddata test, which as of 5.1.38 is giving
platform-dependent results, with the "expected" results being arguably the
wrong ones.  This is upstream at http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=46895
(note that upstream has also disabled it, but only for Solaris, so we still
need this patch).
Still broken in 5.5.14, despite alleged fix.

Also disable sys_vars.plugin_dir_basic, which is broken because
mysql-test-run doesn't set the right value of MYSQL_LIBDIR.  Upstream at
http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52223
Still fails in 5.5.16, even though upstream marked it closed.

Also disable innodb.innodb, which is showing platform-dependent results
as of 5.5.9.  Upstream at http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=60155
