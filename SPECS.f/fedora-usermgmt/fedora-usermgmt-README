more complete documentation of the fedora-usermgmt tools.



This package provides wrappers around useradd, userdel, groupadd and
groupdel to allow predictable but configurable uids/gids. The syntax
of these wrappers is:

* fedora-useradd  <hint-uid> <options>+
* fedora-userdel  <options>+
* fedora-groupadd <hint-gid> <options>+
* fedora-groupdel <option>+

'<options>' are arguments understood by the shadow-utils programs
also. The '<hint-uid>'/'<hint-gid>' parameters of the fedora-*add
wrappers are relative UID/GID. E.g.

| fedora-useradd 42 -r -d /home/joe joe

will create the user 'joe' having '/home/joe' as homedirectory. The
number '42' specifies an UID which is added to a configured, system-wide
base. By default, this base is '300' so that 'joe' will have the uid
342.


The base can be configured by putting a single integer value into

* /etc/fedora/usermgmt/baseuid for bases of uids, and
* /etc/fedora/usermgmt/basegid for bases of gids

As hinted above, both values default to '300'.



This package requires customizations for the used backend programs
(e.g. useradd from shadow-utils). This is done by putting executable
files or links into /etc/fedora/usermgmt/scripts/ which are named like
the backend programs (useradd/-del, ...) and get called with the same
arguments like the fedora-* wrappers but with already expanded UID/GID
numbers.

For shadow-utils, such an /etc/fedora/usermgmt/scripts/useradd
executable could be:

| #! /bin/sh
| u=$1
| shift
| exec /usr/sbin/useradd -u "$u" "$@"



This package supports logging of the executed commands and their
output; a 'log' symlink must be created in /etc/fedora/usermgmt to
enable this feature; e.g. with

| # ln -s /var/log/usermgmt /etc/fedora/usermgmt/log
| # touch /var/log/usermgmt
