Quick Start guide for Open-FCoE
===============================

1. Install fcoe-utils package.  This should also install dcbd, libhbaapi and
   libhbalinux as dependencies.

2. Rename /etc/fcoe/cfg-ethx so it corresponds with name of your network
   interface (e.g. /etc/fcoe/cfg-eth0). Copy and rename this file accordingly
   if you have more interfaces, which should be fcoe-enabled

3. Modify configuration files to enable FCoE. Set FCOE_ENABLE="yes" and
   DCB_REQUIRED="yes".

3. Run 'systemctl enable fcoe.service' to start FCoE per run level. This
   will setup FCoE to start on reboot.

4. Run 'systemctl enable lldpad.service' to start LLDP agent per run
   level. This will setup DCB to start on reboot.

5. Run 'systemctl start lldpad.service' to start LLDP agent.

6. Run 'dcbtool sc ethX dcb on; dcbtool sc ethX app:0 e:1;' for each fcoe-enabled
   interface to setup DCB for FCoE.

7. Run 'systemctl start fcoe.sertvice' to start FCoE.
