Subject: [PATCH 09/17] lircd: handle larger config files in write_socket
 better

Pointed out by Michael Zanetti on list, irsend LIST has issues with long
config files, which didn't exist in maintainer mode, as we were using a
do while loop to make sure we spit out everything. Just use that loop
all the time.
