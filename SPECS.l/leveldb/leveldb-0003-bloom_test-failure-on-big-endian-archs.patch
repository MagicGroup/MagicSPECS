Subject: [PATCH 3/3] bloom_test failure on big endian archs

When running bloom_test on big endian machines it fails due to unacceptable
false positive rate. I've looked into the issue and it seems that the
reason for that is that it passes a different input than when it runs on
little endian. When transforming the input to be little endian it behaves
as expected.
This issue holds up inclusion of ceph to debian due to ceph's use of
leveldb. The fix can be to bump up the acceptable false positives.
