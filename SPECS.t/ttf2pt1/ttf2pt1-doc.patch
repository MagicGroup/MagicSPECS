-<li> One catch is that the X11 Type 1 font library has a rather low limit
-  on the font size. Because of this the fonts with  more complicated
-  outlines and the enabled hint substitution may not fit into
-  this limit. The same applies to the fonts with very complicated
-  outlines or with very many glyphs (especially the fonts with
-  over 256 glyphs). So you will need to excercise caution with
-  these options if you plan using these fonts with X11. Some vendors 
-  such as HP provide the Type 1 implementation licensed from Adobe 
-  which should have no such problem.
-<p>
-
-  But there is a solution even for the generic X11. A patch located
-  in the subdirectory `<tt>app/X11</tt>' fixes this problem as well
-  as some other minor problems. Its description is provided in
-  <A HREF="app/X11/README.html">app/X11/README</A>.
-<p>
-
-  To fix the X11 font library, you have to get the X11 sources. I
-  can recommend the ftp sites of the XFree86 project <A HREF="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org">ftp://ftp.xfree86.org</A>
-  or of the Open Group <A HREF="ftp://ftp.x.org">ftp://ftp.x.org</A>. This patch was made on the sources
-  of XFree86 so you may have better success with applying it to the
-  XFree86 distribution. After you have got the sources, make sure
-  that you can compile them. Then apply the patch as described.
-  Make sure that it was applied properly. Compile the sources again
-  (actually, you need only the fonts library, the fonts server, and
-  possibly the X server). It would be prudent now to save your old
-  font library, font server and, possibly, X server. Then install
-  the new recently compiled versions of these files. Of course,
-  if you know someone who already has compiled these files for the
-  same OS as yours, you can just copy the binary fles from him.
-<p>
-
-  Alas, building the X11 system from the source code is not the
-  easiest thing in the world and if you have no experience it
-  can be quite difficult. In this case just avoid the aforementioned
-  features or check each converted font to make sure that it
-  works properly.
-<p>
-
-<li> The Type1 font library from the standard X11 distribution
-  does not work on HP-UX (at least, up to 10.01). The font server
-  supplied with HP-UX up to 10.01 is also broken. Starting from 
-  HP-UX 10.20 (I don't know about 10.10) they supply a proprietary font

-and limited in capabilities). An example of batch file <tt>winbuild.bat</tt> 
-is provided for MS Visual C/C++. Probably it can be easily adapted for other

-Cygnus <tt>make</tt> almost supports full Makefiles but not quite. Seems
-like its POSIX support is also of the same quality "almost but not quite".
-So another command file <tt>cygbuild.sh</tt> is provided for Cygnus GNU C, also 
-with the preprocessor symbol WINDOWS defined. It is intended to be run from
-the Cygnus BASH shell. To run the programs produced by the Cygnus compiler 
-the Cygnus library file <tt>CYGWIN1.DLL</tt> should be copied first into

-To run the accompanying scripts Perl for Windows will be required as well as
