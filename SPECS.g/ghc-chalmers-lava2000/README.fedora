README.fedora
=============

chalmers-lava2000 packaged for Fedora does not include the
verification modules that use third-party non-free binaries.

You will be able to write, simulate, test, and create VHDL files using
this package.

The lava.vhd has the entity declarations, and is required if you need
to verify the created VHDL file.
