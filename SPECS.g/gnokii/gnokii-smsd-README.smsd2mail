* Make the gnokii user a member of a group that has read and write access to
  the SMS device.  For example on RHL-9 and later and ttyS0, add gnokii to the
  uucp group.  See "ls -l /dev/ttyS*".

* Copy smsd2mail.sh somewhere, eg. /usr/local/sbin, make sure it's executable
  by the gnokii user.

* Configure SMSD_OPTIONS in /etc/sysconfig/gnokii-smsd like:

  SMSD_OPTS="-u /usr/local/sbin/smsd2mail.sh -m file"
