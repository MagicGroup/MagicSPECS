Subject: [PATCH 112/118] char: Throttle when host connection is down#

When the host-side connection goes down, throttle the virtio-serial bus
and later unthrottle when a connection gets established.  This helps
prevent any lost IO (guest->host) while the host connection was down.

Bugzilla: 621484

This commit actually helps the bug mentioned above as no writes will now
get lost because of the throttling done here.  With just the patches
sent earlier for that bug, one write will end up getting lost in the
worst case (host d/c, guest write, host connect).
