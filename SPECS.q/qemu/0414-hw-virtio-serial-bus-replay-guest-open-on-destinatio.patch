Subject: [PATCH 2/2] hw/virtio-serial-bus: replay guest open on destination

This is rewrite of a patch carried in Fedora previously based
on new code upstream, here is the original message, it still applies:
(the original fedora patch was commit id
a9bc20afc1f0604ee81c23b7c67d627e51d2e8d4, this is useful for grepping in
logs, it isn't in upstream)

When migrating a host with with a spice agent running the mouse becomes
non operational after the migration. This is rhbz #725965.

The problem is that after migration spice doesn't know the guest agent
is open.  Spice is just a char dev here. And a chardev cannot query it's
device, the device has to let the chardev know when it is open. Right
now after migration the chardev which is recreated is in it's default
state, which assumes the guest is disconnected.

Char devices carry no information across migration, but the
virtio-serial does already carry the guest_connected state. This patch
passes that bit to the chardev.
